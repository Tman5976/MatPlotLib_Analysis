# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
The purpose of this assignment was to create a presentable graph illustrating the total fares collected by PyBer. The goal is to show the differences in fares collected between three different city types; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The fares were split over a period from January 2019 through April 2019.

## Results

The charts show that urban cities outperformed both suburban and rural cities throughout the entire time frame. Urban cities also brought in substantially more money and had more fares. The week of Jan 01, 2019, saw the lowest money for urban cities at $1661.68. That is higher than any output from both other city types. Urban cities brought in $20,000 more in total fares throughout the year while having lower average costs per fare and driver.

Suburban cities were consistently above rural cities over the period. Suburban cities remained relatively steady throughout the four months, bringing in around $1,000 per week.

## Summary

- Try to reposition some drivers from Urban areas to Suburban and Rural areas. There were more drivers in the Urban area than rides given, and closing that gap would help PyBer work a little more efficiently and remove some demand from the other drivers.

- Consider making a change to seasonal rides for the rural area. In the second week of Jan, there were only $67.65 worth of fares. With an average fare of $34.62 per ride, there may have been two rides that week. Depending on the expenses PyBer has, there is not much room for making a profit during low volume times.

- To try and increase rides in the Suburban types, it may help to offer discounts on fares during certain times of the day. The offer would incentivize individuals commuting to and from work during the workweek.
