# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
The purpose of this assignment was to create a presentable graph illustrating the total fares collected by PyBer. The goal is to show the differences in fares collected between three different city types; Urban, Sububrban, and Rural. The fares are split up over a period from January 2019 through April 2019.

## Results

The above charts show that urban cities outrperformed both suburabn and rural cities throughout the entire time frame. Urban cities also brought in subsantially more money and had more fares. The week of Jan 01, 2019 saw the lowest amount of money for urban cities at $1661.68. That is higher than any output from both other city types. Throughout the year, urban cities brought in $20,000 more in total fares while having lower average costs per fare and per driver.

Suburban cities was consistently above rural cities over the time period. Suburban cities remained rather steady throughout the four months, bringing in around $1,000 per week.

## Summary

- Try to reposition some drivers from Urban areas to Suburban and Rural areas. There were more drivers in the Urban area than rides given and I believe closing that gap would help PyBer work a little more effiently and remove some demand from the other types' drivers.

- Consider making a change to seasonal rides for the rural area. In the second week of Jan, there were only $67.65 worth of fares. With an average fare of $34.62 per ride that means there may have been two rides that week. Depending on the expenses PyBer has there is not much room for making a profit during low volume times.

- To try and increase rides in the Suburban types it may help to offer discounts on fares during certain times of the day. This would be done to incentivize individuals commuting to and from work during the work week.
