# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
The purpose of this assignment was to create a presentable graph illustrating the total fares collected by PyBer. The goal is to show the differences in fares collected between three different city types; Urban, Sububrban, and Rural. The fares are split up over a period from January 2019 through April 2019.

## Results

The above charts show that urban cities outrperformed both suburabn and rural cities throughout the entire time frame. Urban cities also brought in subsantially more money and had more fares. The week of Jan 01, 2019 saw the lowest amount of money for urban cities at $1661.68. That is higher than any output from both other city types. Throughout the year, urban cities brought in $20,000 more in total fares while having lower average costs per fare and per driver.

Suburban cities was consistently above rural cities over the time period. Suburban cities remained rather steady throughout the four months, bringing in around $1,000 per week.
